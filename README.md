**Currency Rate Data Streaming**

Welcome to the Currency Rate Alerts! This tool is designed to fetch currency rates data from Bigpara and Doviz.com, format it, generate a message text, and create an image using a template. It then proceeds to upload the image to Cloudinary, sends messages with the image to Telegram, Instagram, and Twitter, and finally saves the data to a MySQL database. Additionally, it calculates rate changes based on previous data, adjusts image colors accordingly to indicate increases and decreases.
It runs every 3 hours on week days, AWS Lambda is used to run the cron jobs.
